# Deployment

## Configuration

To configure the `api` you should copy `./src/data/config.template.json` to `./src/data/config.dev.json` and modify the content.

```js
{
    "node": {
        "provider": "https://MYNODE/",               /* A node to perform Tangle operations */
        "depth": 3,                                  /* Depth to use for attaches */
        "mwm": 9                                     /* MWM to use for attaches */
    },
    "gridApiEndpoint": "https://GRID-ENDPOINT",      /* Endpoint for the grid api */
    "producer": {
        "id": "PRODUCER-UNIQUE-ID",                  /* Unique ID, has no format */
        "name": "PRODUCER-NAME"                      /* The name of this producer */
    }
}
```

## Build

```shell
npm run build
```

## Deploy

The `api` package is setup to be deployed to zeit/now, you should modify the config in `./now.json` to suit your own requirements and then execute the following.

If you want to use a different name for the config file you can specify an environment variable of CONFIG_ID, e.g. set CONFIG_ID to `dev` will load `config.dev.json` instead.

```shell
now
```
